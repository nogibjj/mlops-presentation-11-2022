00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,140
Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,820
conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:21,040
Now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,240
and so dedicated can long endure.

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,760
We are met on a great battlefield of that war.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,160
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those here

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,960
gave their lives that the nation might live.

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:57,080
It is all together fitting and proper that we should do this.
