Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation
conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived
and so dedicated can long endure.
We are met on a great battlefield of that war.
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those here
gave their lives that the nation might live.
It is all together fitting and proper that we should do this.
